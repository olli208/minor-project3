# Project Watt-Now
Watt-Now is an organization that focuses on reducing the CO2 emissions by advising festivals on their energy supplier. The usage of a different generator can make a lot of difference. Festival organizer usually don't know how much energy they, and they take the advice of the generator seller. The goal of generator sellers is to make money, not to reduce the CO2 emissions. This results in a generator that has power to generate way more energy then necessary. This will increase the CO2 emissions. By giving a good advice and monitoring the generators during the festival, Watt-Now tries to make a difference.  

## Concept
Our idea to help Watt-Now with their problem is to add gamification to the festival. First off, we install a dancing platform for visitors to use during the festival. A pattern will be shown on the screen and they need to step on the corresponding arrows. If they do this correctly they will earn points that will fill up the energy meter for a bit. Once one of the meters is full, the game will end.   

The generated energy goes to the organizers of the festival. With the extra energy then don’t have to use as much energy of the generators as the used to do before and the cost of the generators will be less.  

The winner of the game will get a consumption voucher to use at one of the food trucks. The food truck owners can trade them in at the end of the day at the organizers of the festival. This way the visitors will gather energy by dancing, the organizers have to spend less money on generators, so the CO2 emissions will decrease.    

The saved cost on the generators is going to be used to pay for the consumption vouchers that the food truck owners are handing in.

## Research

### Pavegen
Pavegen generates energy from footsteps by tiles which make it possible to produce energy by walking/standing on it. One step produces `7 watt` energy, equal to `22 seconds light`. If ten tiles of Pavegen will use the whole day by walking people, it will have enough energy to light up a streetlight. The electricity can be used to power appliances directly, or stored for later use. They are rainproof, working underwater at a depth of 1.5m.

Pavegen produces two things:
- energy
- data

The `energy` can be use for electricity and `data` can be use for analyzing by retailers, government etc.

#### Example projects
There is an example of Pavegen that makes it possible to produce energy for the light piles of a football field in Brazil during a football game.

Pavegen was deployed to charge mobile phones by dancing/jumping on the tiles during a festival. It has resulted in 1000 charged mobile phones during the three days festival.

**More example of use**
- Airport
- Busy transport sides
- Shopping centres
- Concert venues
- Sportgrounds
- Next: (car)roads

The possibilities are available with this new way of sustainable. Ofcourse, more research en experiments will develop this technique in the future. The expectation is that this will develop more and more the coming years.

## Use case
With the current information about the usage of energy, what other information do you need to inform and to present, so the users can do something to reduce the usage of energy?  

## Stakeholders
* Festival organizers: They want to know how much energy is used by every team. The second thing they care about is how efficient they are and when teams are peaking in energy usage.

* Watt-now: This team wants to create insight in how sustainable the festival is and how they can improve the sustainability by advising the organization.

* Visitors: They want to have a good time on the festival. It’s important for them to know how sustainable the festival is.
